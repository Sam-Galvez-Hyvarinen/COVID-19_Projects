Covid Case Study: Capstone Project 

Description: 
This project is for the Google Analytics Capstone Project. I wanted to showcase what Iâ€™ve learned throughout the program by using real-world data that everyone could relate to and gain insights from. 
For this project, I decided to go with data collected over 16 months during the pandemic. From 2020 to the spring of 2021. This data is collected from hundreds of countries around the world. It also dives into covid infection rates, vaccination totals per country, and covid death percentages (based on the country's population). As well as projections for future infection rates for some of these countries. This dataset is for a fictional travel company whose goal is to provide safe travel for those who are immunocompromised or Covid conscious.
